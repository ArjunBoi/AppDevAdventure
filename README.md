# AppDevAdventure
Public repository created as part of the app-dev requirements for CSS-545 

1. I've chosen to go with **Android** as my intended platform for this project. I don't own any Apple devices, and I imagine that that lack of native support would have me running around trying VMs, which sounds exhausting. I also don't have a device I could test my app on, so Android makes the most sense for me.
2. A quick google search informed me that Kotlin seems to be the easiest and the most well-documented/supported programming language for Android app development. I'm new to mobile app development and as such, I will gladly take the easier way in.
3. I would like to take advantage of the Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM) feature and develop an application that supports both Android and iOS, since that is the bare minimum I would expect from any other mobile app. Maybe desktop support can be extended in the future if time allows.
